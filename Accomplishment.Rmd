Summer Internship in St.Thomas University

June,2015 to August,2015

API (Access Protocols Interface), is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. The API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface components. In this project, an API interface with Excel is constructed in order to access to weather information generated by the WeatherBug Network. By using the functions Webfunction and FilterXML from Excel along with the WeatherBug API Key, all of the following parameters are recorded: Outdoor Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Light, Precipitation, Wet Bulb Temperature, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Date, Time, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Humidity, Minimum Humidity, Maximum Pressure, Minimum Pressure, and Gusts. Such access permits to create a database of spatial statistics from different weather stations that belong to the same network. The used protocol might be extended to other weather service providers as Weather Underground and the National Weather Service.
